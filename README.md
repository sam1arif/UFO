# UFOs

## Overview of the project

  We created a webpage by using JavaScript, HTML and CSS that shows data about UFO sightings in the U.S. On the webpage, we also put filters by date, city, state, country and shape of UFO that was sighted so people who are interested could filter for a specific date, city etc. 
  
 ## Results
 
  By adding the city, state, country and shape criteria besides the date, anyone can filter the data by their preferred criteria by filtering it by mentioned search criteria.

## Summary

In sum, the webpage has one main drawback: that is lack of a button. By adding a button we could make it easier to filter the data for preferred outputs.
